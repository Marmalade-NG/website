## Introduction

Marmalade-NG will introduce a new concept called **Smart Buyer Wallet**.

It is currently *in development* on a specific branch, and will be released soon on the next Marmalade NG deployment.

The objective is to allow users to create wallets dedicated to purchases on Marmalade NG. These wallets are managed by a dedicated smart contract.

Smart Buyers wallets will bring many new features and possibilities:

- Bidding on a collection.
- Bidding on a specific list of tokens. (with "escrowing" only the price for a single token)
- Delegates purchase to a Market-Place.

With the insurance of staying 100% decentralized, 100% non-custodial, 100% safe.
The user keeps the control of his funds at any time.
