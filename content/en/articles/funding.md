How is Marmalade NG funded ?

<!--more-->

---

The main developer started the project during his free-time, and will not benefit from the incomes of the platforms. Expenses will be covered by:

### Bug bounties of Marmalade V2

Once Kadena confirms that Marmalade V2 is eligible to Immunefi bug bounties program, critical issues (loss of funds, token steals) still remaining after Marmalade V2 Mainnet release will be reported.

Income will be used for development expenses, rewarding initials supporters, and creating a bug bounty program.

### Sales of the unique first collection and first minted tokens

Instead of just requesting donation or rewards to a given address, I prefer to sell officials Marmalade NG's NFTs.

NFTs from this collections are expected to have no value, and should be considered as a pure donation... But they are freely tradable, and maybe will have a real value in the future. And further, these NFTs have a 10% royalty policy attached.
