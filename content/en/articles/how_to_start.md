Starting to develop on top of Marmalade NG

<!--more-->

Working directly with Marmalade NG contracts is intended mainly for developers of:
  - Marketplaces
  - Wallets
  - Other Frontend and UX tools like minters, ...
  - Special tokens developers

But simple users and creators like artists are not supposed to go deeper into Marmalade. But rather use upcoming minting tools.

---

1 - **Read the documentation**

- https://marmalade-ng.readthedocs.io

- and eventually https://marmalade-bridge-ng.readthedocs.io

---

2 - **Read the documentation (again)**

---

3 - **Develop with Marmalade NG in REPL**:

I maintain a special branch of my kadena_repl_sandbox with Marmalade NG already included and ready.
https://github.com/CryptoPascal31/kadena_repl_sandbox/tree/marmalade-ng

---

4 - **Play on Testnet**

[Deployment references]({{< ref "deployment_and_links.md" >}} "Deployment")

Moreover the explorer can be easily switched to Testnet. (button "Settings" in the top bar)
